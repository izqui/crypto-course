# Introduction to Crypto

* Respect standards, not try to invent yourself
* When used incorrectly, the system is completely insecure (WEP)

### Symetric encryption 
Both parties share key, that the attacker doesn't not. The encryption algorithm is public, the only part that is secret is the key. 

* Encrypt: E(text, key) -> cipher
* Decrypt: D(cipher, key) -> text

Type of keys:

* Single use key: encrypted mail.
* Multiple use key: encrypt files in file system.

# What is crypto?
* Key negociation
* Secure comunication with key

Also...

* Digital signatures
* Anon comunication
	* Mixed net -> Alice talks to bob but Bob has no idea how is talking to him, but he can reply to it. 
* Digital cash
	* Anon
	* Prevent double spending -> When trying to double spend your anon identity is voided.

### Protocols

P2P	
* Elections -> Compute the majority but keep the identity of the individual voters private.

* Private auctions

### Zero knowledge (proof of knowledge)
**N = p*q**

Proof you know the factors of N, without revealing the factors itself

###Â Rigorous science
* Define threat models
* Propose a construction
* Prove that breaking the construction under the threat mode will solve an underlying problem
