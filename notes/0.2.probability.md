# Discrete probability

**Universe** = finite set

*U = {0, 1}^n*

**Probability distribution** *P* over *U*, P of U -> Z between [0, 1]

Sum of P(x) = 1

Example: U = {0, 1}^2 -> P(0,0) = 1/2, P(0,1) = 1/8, P(1,0) = 1/8, P(1,1) = 1/4

#### Types of distribution

* **Uniform distribution** x€U -> P(x) = 1/|U| *size of universe (modulus)*
* **Point distribution** P(x0) = 1 and other elements that are not x0 P(x) = 0

#### Events
For a subset A in U, P(A) = Sum of P(x) in A € [0,1]

Exercise: 

U = {0,1}^8; A = {all x in U such that *lsb2 = 11*} *Two least significant bits (Last two bits are 0)*

P(A) = 2^6/2^8 = 1/2^2 = **1/4**

##### The union bound
P(A1 U A2) ≤ P(A1) + P(A2)

#### Random variable
Takes values from set V and induces them

X(y) = lsb(y) ->
P(X=0) = 1/2

##### Uniform random variable

r(x) = x => P(x=a) = 1/|U|

Example:

r is a uniform random variable on {0,1}^2
X=r1+r2
 
P(X=2) = 1/2 (Because you need {0, 0, 1, 1}) WRONG. it is 1/4

##### Randomized algorithm
* Deterministic algorithms: Always A(m) = y
* Randomized algorithm: Every time the algorithm is ran, r is different A(m, r) = y
So the output changes every time we run the algorithm

#### Independence

When A happens, this doesn't give any info in whether B happens. 

**P(A^B) = P(A) * P(B)**

Example:

Given U = {0,1}^2 and r <- U

X=lsb(r1), Y=msb(r2)

P(X=0 and Y=0) = P(r=00) = 1/2 * 1/2 = **1/4**


#### XOR
x xor y = x+y mod 2

Y random variable in {0,1}^n & X uniform random variable {0, 1}^n

Z = Y XOR X is uniform variable on {0, 1}^n
